[Home](/accsus-components/)

On this site I publish a collection of accessible and sustainable [web components](/accsus-components/components/). These can typically be used on any website and can be adapted to your needs. 

## Accessibility
With accessible I mean components that can be used by all users, regardless of their (in)abilities. Some components are specifically made for people with a disability, to enable them to use websites. 

## Sustainability
With sustainability I mean components that are lightweight and do not use more resources than needed. With that in mind, less energy is being used and the CO2 footprint is as low as possible. 

## Disclaimer and bugs
The code snippets in this library are often based on other available codes and in some cases adapted to meet my own needs and standards. Where possible, I have linked to the source of the original codes.

Do you run into problems with the provided codes or do you think they can be improved? Let me know on [Github](https://github.com/alverdae/accsus-components) or contact me at my [main website](https://alverdae.com/en/contact-en/).
